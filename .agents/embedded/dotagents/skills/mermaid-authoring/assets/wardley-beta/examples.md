# Wardley Map examples

## Software platform strategy (complete feature set)

What this shows: nearly every construct working together — custom evolution stage labels, anchor, sourcing decorators, inertia, evolve arrows, accelerators/deaccelerators, numbered annotations, and notes — the shape a real strategy map takes once it's fleshed out, not just a toy diagram.

note "Migrate to cloud-native database" [0.60, 0.50]
```

## Pipeline: one component's evolution variants

What this shows: a component that exists as different implementations at different evolution stages (a database as file system -> SQL -> NoSQL -> managed cloud DB) plotted along one shared visibility line — the construct for "this thing evolves through these concrete forms," not just an abstract arrow.

```mermaid
wardley-beta
title Pipeline Evolution

component Database [0.40, 0.60]

pipeline Database {
  component "File System" [0.25]
  component "SQL DB" [0.50]
  component "NoSQL" [0.70]
  component "Cloud DB" [0.85]
}
```

## Dual-label custom evolution axis

What this shows: relabeling the X-axis with both a generic stage name and the classic Wardley term (Genesis/Concept, Custom/Emerging, etc.) — useful when presenting to an audience unfamiliar with Wardley's own vocabulary.

```mermaid
wardley-beta
title Dual Label Stages

evolution Genesis / Concept -> Custom / Emerging -> Product / Converging -> Commodity / Accepted

component Novel Idea [0.05, 0.20]
component Custom Solution [0.35, 0.50]
component Product [0.65, 0.70]
component Utility [0.95, 0.90]
```
